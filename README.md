# prosto-reader it is open project
The project was conceived as an educational one. At the moment, the project is fully functional, opens pdf files. 
But since it is open, you can add other formats as well. 
The PDF is opened through the python-popller bileothek. Owners of Windows will not be able to modify this proposal, 
since the python-poppler project is compiled only for linux.
And if you like my design, feel free to use it.
The application was created on ubuntu 20.04.
